Tips:
If the dough is too thick, add some milk.
If the dough is too thin, add some Wheat flour.
You don't have to spread the dough on the pan. Just drop it in one place and it'll spread by itself. 
When bubbles form on the pancake, flip it over. 
The pancake is done when both sides have a goden brownish color.
